![Coding Setup](/images/coding-setup.png)

As you may know, I love coding. I also love design - typography, colors, all of 
it. So, my coding setup has to be perfect. Here is how I did it.

### Colorscheme

For IntelliJ, iTerm2, Neovim, Firefox and Emacs, I use the 
[Nord theme](https://www.nordtheme.com/). I like this theme because it is low 
contrast, easily readable, and looks _good_. Furthermore, it comes with many 
[ports](https://www.nordtheme.com/ports), so it is available for pretty much any
application.

- [JetBrains](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10321-nord)
- [iTerm2](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-iterm2)
- [Neovim](https://github.com/shaunsingh/nord.nvim) (unofficial port)
- [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/nord-milav/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search)
  (unofficial port, made by me!)
- [Emacs](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-emacs)

Other color schemes I like are One Dark Pro and Tokyo Night.

### Font

Fonts are just as important as the theme. They need to be monospaced, easily 
legible, and have a variety of weights. Furthermore, some fonts come with 
[coding ligatures](https://medium.com/larsenwork-andreas-larsen/ligatures-coding-fonts-5375ab47ef8e), 
but personally I find them annoying.

Fonts I like are

- [SF Mono](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/)
- [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) (without ligatures)
- [Source Code Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Code+Pro)
- [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode), again without ligatures
- Menlo (Apple default)
