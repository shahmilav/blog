The journey began with VSCode. I moved there after a few years with IntelliJ, mostly due to the hype. Never loved it, stayed with it for a year. Around this time, I also began launching `nano` from Terminal.app; it was my first CLI editor. Mainly used nano to edit configuration files. 

I then began learning `vim`, used it religiously for two months before getting annoyed by the configuration. Vim wasn't fun for the most part, but it introduced me to something that I still use today: Modal editing.

After my run with Vim, I learned about NeoVim, the Lua configuration, the LSP support. It was beautiful. Around this time I also jumped back to IntelliJ from VSCode. I used IntelliJ for Java, neovim for anything else. To this day, I infrequently launch `nvim`, mostly out of habit, to edit configuration files.

After a long stretch with neovim that is just ending, I reached the ultimate solution. Doom Emacs. The glory of emacs, with modal editing. It was truly love at first sight.

The configuration, the language support... Emacs (+ evil) is so well designed. As a configuration language, Elisp is in my opinion, is tied with Lua, but leagues better than VimScript.

The real beauty of Emacs is the power. It is a beast. IntelliJ is still better for Java (which is why I use it), but Emacs handles every other language with ease. Yet, if something is not needed, Emacs never annoys you. It is there, waiting, never intruding.

`Magit` is amazing, and I have only scratched the surface of what it has to offer.

`org mode` is great. Really fun to use, love it way more than markdown. If only `11ty` had an option to write blog posts with org.

I don't think I intend to leave Emacs anytime soon. 

In fact, this very post was written in Emacs.
