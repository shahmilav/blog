Yesterday was a very fun day. We visited Blenheim Palace, located about ten 
minutes from Oxford. After that, we drove an hour to Leicester.

## Blenheim Palace

Our first stop was Blenheim palace. Best known as the birthplace of Winston
Churchill, Kunal mentioned that it was more beautiful than Buckingham Palace.

Blenheim was beautiful, though. Built in the year 1705 by the 1st Duke of Marlborough 
after he won the Battle of Blenheim, it has been their home ever since (even 
now!)

Even the tickets, which are valid year-round, look good. My title is "Master Milav Shah." Riana cried since hers was "Miss Riana Shah."

The inside was stunning. There was ancient armor and weapons, colorful paintings, and giant marble statues. The place, at least to me, had an evident Roman influence, even having a bust of Emperor Hadrian<sup>`[1]`</sup>.

The Churchill exhibit was also pretty good. I saw his bedroom and his funeral
procession. No idea why these two things were right next to each other.

The outside was just as beautiful. While lacking statues and art, it made up with fantastic architecture and beautiful gardens. We had a great photoshoot 
outside, with everyone running to the camera after each shot. In two of them, you can see Aarush and Kavya running prematurely.

The place was great, and we still have so much to do that the plan is to come
back tomorrow (Saturday) to explore the rest.

## Sangeet

After Blenheim, we drove to the hotel. From there we took a coach bus to the sangeet venue.

The sangeet was pretty good! This was my first wedding so I didn't know what to expect. I ended up having lots of fun.

There was dancing (we didn't perform, though), good food, and tons of family I hadn't met for a long time. I met Birenkaka, Bhavinkaka, and the groom, 
Kushanmama. There were a bunch of other relatives I know, like Radhika & Nick.

Towards the middle, Kavya, Aarush, Aatman, Riana, and I went outside to talk and 
play. I took so many great pictures.

As fun as it was, we were exhausted in the end. It ended at around 11:30, and 
our sleep schedule was already messed up. Everyone slept on the coach bus and
changed quickly at home. I slept as soon as I fell on the bed.
