Yesterday was super fun. It was the wedding of Kushan and Ashka. The scenery at the venue was great; there were so many things to do and so many places for me to take pictures. 

## The Wedding

The wedding was located at Keythorpe Manor, a small cottage in the English countryside. We woke up late since we got no sleep the night before, so we missed the _Jaan_ arrival. The drive to the manor was super scenic. The English countryside is beautiful, with large farms, old houses, and so many animals. I tried taking a few pictures, but the images do no justice to the area's beauty.

The manor was a well-tended home, with unique landscaping and a beautiful countryside view. To Riana’s delight, they even had sheep! There were many flowers, from lavender to roses, with everything in between. 

The gardens were also beautiful. It was very picturesque, and I took countless photos there. 

Towards the front of the manor was a small swing. Everyone spent a lot of time on the swing, taking photos, swinging, and just talking. All of us cousins had so much fun in the gardens and on the swing.

I didn’t pay much attention to the wedding ceremony (sorry), and I missed the _pheras_ and the actual marriage. However, what I missed in that, I more than made up playing outside with my cousins. The weather was so good, and we had great fun playing and talking. I took at least fifty pictures that day.

## The Reception

The reception was a sigh of relief: no more Indian clothes, no more mojri. While a suit and dress shoes are not the most comfortable clothes, they are much better than Indian clothes.

The atmosphere at the reception was brilliant. We started with opening drinks and snacks in the barn. I had _lots_ of orange juice and chili baby corn. It was super fun, and the photos came out beautiful. The lighting was _just right_. 

After the opening, the main reception began. We were seated at tables, and the announcer (Kushan’s friend) told the audience funny stories about Kushan and Ashka. 

We (the group of cousins) also played with Alex, our second cousin who we met there. Aarush, Aatman, and Alex ended up being great friends.

Later in the night, after dinner, everyone danced. It was so much fun, jumping around and dancing. We danced for a long time, after which Kavya, Riana, and I sat outside, Aarush and Aatman tagging along.

Later in the night, there were fireworks. It was cool, and was coordinated with the music perfectly. They were fantastic; they lit up the entire English countryside.

We boarded the coach bus late at night when the party ended. To my amazement, Day wanted to stay for longer! I have not seen day have so much fun in a long time.
