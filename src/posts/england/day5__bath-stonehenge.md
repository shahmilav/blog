Two days ago, we went to the City of Bath and Stonehenge. It was a fun day, but we partly felt that our money went down the drain (haha).

## The City of Bath
First, we left Bristol, where our hotel was, to Bath. The primary attraction in Bath was the Roman Baths (how obvious) built by the Romans in 67AD. It is one of the only natural hot spring baths in England. 

The tickets were costly. We entered, picked up audio guides (note: they suck), and looked at the Great Bath. 

<blockquote class="blockquote text-center">It was at this moment that we knew â€“ this was a waste of money.</blockquote>

The "Great Bath" was a rectangular puddle, colored in a dirtier green than the River Thames, with no one even allowed to touch it (not that you would want to). The actual pool was the only Roman part, with the statues and terrace built afterward in the 1800s. Day and I looked at each other and had the same thought. People must come here, not for the bath, but for the view of Bath Abbey (again, Europe is very creative) behind us.

We finally found a way downstairs and looked through the museum. This part was more interesting. We saw a bunch of Roman coins, altars with Latin engravings, and statutes. I finally got to show my Latin knowledge to Mumma and Day. I got most things correct, including translating "Aquae Sulis" or "the waters of Sulis." Inside the museum, we saw the Great Drain (where our money went), as well as Roman sewage systems.
