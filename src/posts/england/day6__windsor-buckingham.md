On Monday we went to Windsor Castle and Buckingham Palace. It was a packed day
with lots to do and see.

## Windsor Castle

First, we went to Windsor Castle. Built in 1070 by William the Conqueror, it was
built to serve as a fortress to defend the west of London. However, due to its 
location, it ended up being used as a royal residence.

The castle is huge. We got some amazing shots of the outside before going 
inside. The first thing we saw inside was swords and guns. A row of armor, 
circles of swords, and a display case of guns dating to the 1800s. 
All we saw for the first thirty minutes were weapons after weapons after weapons.

We saw a few rifles four feet long and smaller pistols that were very decorated. Swords with intricate drawings and suits of armor dating to the 1500s. The entire place could have served as an armory fit for a small army. There were tall maces, spears, lances, detailed shields, and hundreds of arrows.

After the weapons came the rooms. There was a room in which everything was made
of gold, another filled with paintings.

After that, we saw the throne room. Due to a question that Aarush asked, the guide let us go _up_ close to Queen Victoria's chair. Made in India, it was made of silver, gold, pearls, and rubies. It is so special even Queen Elizabeth doesn't sit on it. Thank you, Aarush, for asking whatever you may have asked.

After the throne room, numerous royal closets, drawing rooms, and bedrooms, we came to the Platinum Jubilee exhibit. It was in a large room, and there were pictures on all sides. We read about the Queen's coronation in 1953, the clothes she wore, and the celebration that took place. Her gown was huge - I have no idea how she did not trip when wearing that dress. If it were _my_ coronation, I would wear something safer to guarantee that I do not humiliate myself.

Windsor was fun for the most part. However, it is so huge that the three hours we spent there were insufficient. We barely got to see anything! Next time I come to England, I will return to Windsor to finish what I started.

## Buckingham Palace

After Windsor, we drove for about an hour to Buckingham Palace. I did not see much of London yet, as Buckingham is in the complete opposite corner of London than the River Thames, along which everything else is located.

We got tickets and walked towards the palace. The entry is from the side, so we did not see the front of the Palace yet. The first thing we saw when we entered the palace was a large square filled with reddish rocks. 

The palace courtyard was surprisingly disappointing, but we moved on fast. Thankfully, unlike Bath and Blenheim Castle, the multimedia guide was pretty good. 

We saw the large hall, the staircase, and many, many paintings. Honestly, even though I took a lot of time in each room, I feel like I moved very fast.

The palace was fun, and the best exhibit was, once again, the Platinum Jubilee exhibit. This time, instead of photos and a large gown, there was jewelry. 

We saw the Girls of Great Britain and Ireland tiara, a bunch of earrings, and the Dehli Durbar necklace. The collection was beautiful, and they saved the best for last: the necklace was given by the Nizam of Hyderabad to Elizabeth II.

It was very pretty, given by the Nizam for Elizabeth's wedding. Everything there was either given to the Queen for either her eighteenth birthday or as a wedding present. In any case, we were lucky to see this stuff; it is a part of the Queen's collection and was only out in the exhibit for the Jubilee.

After the palace, it was getting late. The gardens, usually beautiful, were nonexistent due to the past heat wave. We skipped the area pretty fast.

After we left Buckingham, we walked a bit to where our minibus was parked. This was going to be the last ride on the bus; once he dropped us off at Leonardo Royal Tower Bridge Hotel, we would not use the bus again.

This time, we got to see London in all its glory. Peter drove us from the palace along the River Thames. We saw the London Eye, Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, Tower Bridge, the Shard, and finally, next to our hotel, the Tower of London. It was a great way to hype up excitement for the next three days.
