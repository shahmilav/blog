This was a day when everyone did what they wanted, and it was definitely my favorite day of the trip. I went to the Museum with Mumma, Day, and Riana; everyone else went to the London Eye and Leicester Square for shopping.

## Westminster Abbey

First, we decided to go to the to the British Museum. We took the hop-on hop-off bus to the stop at Covent Garden, from which you can walk to the museum, but my last-minute research using the bus wifi made me change the plan. _We should go to the Westminster Abbey first since that closes first!_

We did just that and got off at the Westminster station. From here, we had an excellent view of Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament.

We walked towards Big Ben. It looked stunning, and I am happy the scaffolding from the renovation was removed. It would have seemed so ugly and ruined every single picture.

Westminster Abbey was right next to the Houses of Parliament. One of the main reasons I wanted to go was that it was the burial place of many influential people, including Sir Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, and numerous members of British royalty.

I saw the tombstones of many, many people. Westminster Abbey was a place for meaningful, famous, and royal people to be buried. There was even a lmemorial for Winston Churchill, who is not buried here but near Blenheim Palace.

We then saw Newton's tombstone, the most decorated one. There was a massive statue, and underneath our feet, right where I was standing, _him_. Newton, technically his body, was less than 5 feet below me. It felt weird.

## The best lunch ever

After looking at a ton of stuff at Westminster Abbey, we diverted from the rest of the group. We walked towards Dishoom Covent Garden for lunch.

This area of London seemed much more likable. There were theaters everywhere, and it overall just had a good vibe. 

The restaurant we went to was amazing. It was fancy but had such a vibe – or as Mumma called it, it was "happening." It was loud, exciting, and it was just _fun_. The food was good, and the atmosphere was great. We also got a great seat right next to the window. 

The restaurant was also very on theme. Even the bathrooms were on theme, with old Indian-style flush mechanisms and a door that said "Do not enter – a ghost lives here!" in Hindi. It was definitely one of the best restaurants I have ever been to.

## The British Museum

After eating at Dishoom, we walked toward the Museum. It had begun to drizzle, but we didn't mind. It was part of the London experience - raining randomly. 

The museum had a pretty huge line, and it was rainy. The back entrance, which usually has a much smaller line, was closed. Thankfully the line, as large as it was, moved fast, and we barely got wet since the rain slowed down. Right as we entered, the rain started again. 

When we entered the trip, we found that the maps cost £2. Since the museum was so huge (I have concluded that you could spend a month in it and still not finish), we pretty much had to get one.

### Egypt

I had a mental list of what I wanted to see: the Parthenon marbles, the Rosetta stone, etc. We first saw the Rosetta stone. I won't get into the history, but this was one of the most influential rocks ever found. It led the way in decoding other Egyptian rocks. It is a rock that helped translate other stones.

I spent a lot of time in the Egypt exhibit since it was huge. Sphinxes, sarcophagi, and like ten busts of Amenhotep III.


### Greece

After Egypt, there was Greece. We saw a bunch of busts, statues, and vases. There was all kinds of very amazing things. 

We moved forward, and then saw a monument that was perfectly rebuilt as it stood in Greece. It looked really beautiful. The marble stones, the columns, the inscriptions – it was exactly how I would imagine a Greek monument.

The next room had the Parthenon marbles. They were very well crafted, and looked beautiful. The exhibit was pretty huge, and the museum had a _lot_ of the marbles. The rest was in Athens, in Greece's own Parthenon museum.

### India & China

After spending a lot of time in the Greece section, we went upstairs to the India & China section. We passed through an exhibit on Chinese Jade, and then saw the China exhibit. It was pretty cool, but we moved fast. Towards the other side of the same room there was Indian stuff. There were statues and scriptures dating to Emperor Ashoka. Statues of gods, pottery, and toys. There even was a Jainism area, where they had statues of Jain teachers, and a bunch of artifacts.

Further down the room, there was Buddhist stuff. There were remains from the Buddhist Amaravati monastery in East India. The stonework was pretty amazing and very detailed. "Modern" architecture doesn't hold a candle to stuff they built before 1700. It is really sturdy and beautiful stuff.

### Mesopotamia

The museum was closing in about fifteen minutes, so we were slowly leaving. And just then, I saw something on my map. 

The Standard of Ur is something we learned about in sixth grade. The history is irrelevant, but I really wanted to see it. So I did the only logical thing - run up three floors to quickly take a look, then somehow find Mumma and Day downstairs.

The Standard is amazing, and I wish I had known about it before so I could properly appreciate it. After looking at it for about two minutes, I ran back downstairs. However, the China door we entered earlier was locked! Mumma and Day were inside, and they could leave, but since it was closing time, I could not enter. 

I called Mumma, and we arranged to meet in the Great Hall. We somehow regrouped, and made our way to the exit.


## Night Bus

Later, we met up with the others at Piccadilly Circus. They had just finished with the shopping, and we planned to take a night tour of London via bus. Piccadilly Circus was beautiful, it just had a fun vibe. Everyone else, especially Aarush and Aatman were super happy for the first time in a long time. They all bought a bunch of stuff at Oxford street, and really enjoyed London Eye.

The Night Bus was fun at first, but got boring later. We got to see Westminster Abbey, the Houses of Parliament, and Big Ben (although it wasn't lit up due to the renovation). We crossed Westminster Bridge and got a view of the Shard, London Eye, and in the distance, Tower Bridge.

There was some more driving in the area north of the Thames, and this is where it got boring. No one was really _that_ excited when we crossed over Tower Bridge.

However, the day overall was super fun for everybody, since everybody got to do whatever they wanted and enjoyed it. I got my museum done, Aarush the London Eye, Aatman visited the world's largest Lego store, and Kavya had fun shopping.
