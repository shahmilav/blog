## Golden Jubilee Bridge
It was the last day of the trip and we still hadn't done the one thing Day _really_ wanted to do - cross the Golden Jubilee Bridge. So, the four of us woke up early to go there.

We decided to take the Tube, so we walked to Tower Hill station (right next to the Tower of London). The Tube is very efficient. It was super fast, clean (compared to the New York subway), and was fun to use! It got us to the bridge in about ten minutes.

The bridge was worth going. We got beautiful pictures of Westminster, and we walked both sides to try and spot grafitti. We wanted to find the grafitti from Shahrukh Khan's song [Challa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a4izd3Rvdw&themeRefresh=1), but instead, all we saw was a sign that read 

<blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
This wall has been coated with anti-grafitti paint.
</blockquote>

So that mission was a bust.

Still, it was super fun waking up early to go to the bridge. We got beautiful pictures and was really fun to see.

## Sky Garden
We then took the Tube back to Tower Hill, and checked out our rooms.
Then, we went to Sky Garden. We had wanted to go there before, but never got a chance until now.

Sky Garden was really fun. There was a line, but after that, we got to go straight to the top.

The view was beautiful. We could see Canary Wharf, the Tower of London, Tower Bridge, London City Hall, London Bridge, HMS Belfast, The Shard, London Eye, and St. Pauls Cathedral. In the distance, but still visible was Big Ben. Buckingham wasn't visible, because, as I've mentioned, it is in the complete other corner of London than everything else. Either way, it was stunning.

The outside balcony was cool, and so was the inside. It was a very nice place, defined by the amazing view of the entire London. In my opinion, we left too soon.

## Madness at Heathrow
We then took the Tube back to Tower Hill and picked up our bags from concierge. Then, we called two Ubers to drive us to Heathrow. 

The drive was long, but I fell asleep (like almost everyone else) in the car. At Heathrow, we checked in, went through security (which had a long line), 

At the airport, I went to go look at sunglasses and watches. In the end though, we just got a wide variety of chocolates from Cadbury and Lindt.

Then, we ran. The gate was "closing", in other words, boarding, and we had to get there. We thankfully got there in time.

The plane took off, and I took one last look at England. The plane ride was hard, due to the seats, but before I knew it, I was in New York. I could tell due to the AC.

Overall, the trip was a lot of fun. It had many great things, and was defined by history, adventure, and family. I really enjoyed it, and had lots of fun with my cousins.
