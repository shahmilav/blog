England was a cool place. It was diverse and had lots to do and see. Yet, in many aspects, in sucked compared to the US.

## tl;dr
1. Air conditioning
2. Bottled water
3. Everything closes at 5
4. Obsession over royalty
5. Lack of trash cans

## 1. Air Conditioning
The major problem I had with the UK was with air conditioning, or lack thereof. In 90% of the buildings you go to, there is probably no AC. It gets so hot and it was a real pain for Day to find hotels with AC, and the one he didn't book, Leicester, had no AC and was a serious pain.

## 2. Water bottles
Getting _cold_ water was hard. In the US water bottle refilling stations are a dime a dozen, but in the UK, you were really lucky if you found one. So often you would just have to stick to tap water, and British tap water does not taste that good.

## 3. Everything closes at 5:00
What is with these odd timings! Just about every business, from a small shop to a Pret, closes at five. The British Museum opens at 10:30 and closed at 5. Buckingham Palace's last ticket was at 5:15. It gets really annoying especially when searching for food or for shopping.

## 4. Obsession over Royalty
This really irks me. I get that they are "royal", but why do we need to be obsessed over them? They are just people after all. Why does everything need to be royal? Our hotel in London, for example, was Leonardo _Royal_ Tower Bridge. Was there a need for the _Royal_?

## 5. Lack of garbage cans
This got really annoying on the last day. We had breakfast on the go from Pret, and had to carry a bag of garbage the entire walk to Sky Garden. Why can't there just be more garbage cans in places?
